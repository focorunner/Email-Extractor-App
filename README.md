# Email-Extractor-App

PHP-based. Extracts emails from messy ASCII text. Works pretty well. 

Simple app that will accept file or paste ASCII input, and use a RegEx
matching function to extract email addressed, so they can be displayed
in a convenient list. This is sometimes helpful to preprocess email
lists for upload to create contacts for bulk email services.

This should only be done to extra email addresses for an established
base of contacts which have given permission for you to send them
emails.

I wasn't concerned about design on the front-end, so if you use/update 
this, you'll probably want to work on that. There are some functional
improvements that could be made which I never had time to make also.
